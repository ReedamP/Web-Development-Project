# Web-Development-Project

A Web Development Project coded using client-side languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as server-side languages PHP and mySQL.

The database shown in the website was created using mySQL commands, however these commands will be too time consuming for the viewer to write out, just so the database is shown in the website for all the functionalities to work.

Therefore, for simplicity sake, a video was created to show the overview of the website..https://vimeo.com/268498179.

Any web development IDE can be used to view the code, I had used ATOM so it is highly recommended to use that.

How to view the code which developed the website:
1.	Download and install ATOM https://atom.io/ or any suitable IDE.
2.	Download the Web Development Project files.
3.	Feel free to inspect the code.
